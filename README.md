# React Hooks
(Normal JS utility functions)
 - useState() -> Superpowerful State Variables in react
 - useEffect()
 
 # Whenever state variables update, react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component)

if no dependecny array useEffect will be called on every render.
if dependency array is empty => [] => useEffect will be called only once(on initial render)
if dependency array has some value => [btnName] => useEffect will be called whenever the value of btnName changes.

Never create state variable outside of your component and inside if else condition,for loops , functions.
RouterProvider actually provide configuration to our app
