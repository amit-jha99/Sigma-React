# Sigma React ðŸ”¥

# Parcel
- Dev build
- local server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm - written in C++
- Caching - Faster Builds
- Image optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compress
- Parcel is like the manager of all the library packages.
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting 
- Differential Bundling-support older browsers
- Diagnostics
- Error Handling - gives us better error suggestions
- HTTPS
- Tree Shaking -remove unused code 
- Different dev and production bundles are different

Two types of Export/Import

- Default Export/Import
 export default Component;
 import Component from "path";

 - Named Export/Import
  export const Component;
  import {Component} from "path";

# React Hooks
(Normal JS utility functions)
 - useState() -> Superpowerful State Variables in react
 - useEffect()
 
 # Whenever state variables update, react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component)

if no dependecny array useEffect will be called on every render.
if dependency array is empty => [] => useEffect will be called only once(on initial render)
if dependency array has some value => [btnName] => useEffect will be called whenever the value of btnName changes.

Never create state variable outside of your component and inside if else condition,for loops , functions.
RouterProvider actually provide configuration to our app


# 2 types Routing in web apps
- Client side routing
- Server side routing(make the network call fetch the /about.html from  the  server refreshes the whole page)


# React life Cycle

- Parent Constructor
- Parent Render

  - First constructor
  - First Render

  - Second Constructor
  - Second Render

  <DOM UPDATED - IN SINGLE BATCH></DOM>
  - First ComponentDidmount

  - Second ComponentDidMount

- Parent ComponentDidMount

by doing this react is optimising the performance
